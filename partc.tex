Let us now use Euler's explicit method to solve the equation $\dfrac{dU}{d \tau}= AU+b(\tau)$ in time. The scheme gives
\begin{align*}
U^{k+1} &= U^{k} + \Delta t\Big(\dfrac{1}{h^2}AU^{k}+\dfrac{1}{h^2}b(\tau)\Big)\\
 &= \Big( I_{N} + \dfrac{\Delta t}{h^2} A\Big)U^{k} + \dfrac{\Delta t}{h^2}\cdot b(\tau)
\end{align*}
The code is available below in \ttt{tempEE.m}.

We cannot choose $\Delta x$ and $\Delta t$ as we want to obtain a stable solution.The following tests have been made :

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|}
\hline 
$\Delta x$ & $\Delta t$ &$\frac{\Delta t}{\Delta x^2}$ &\textbf{Stability} \\ 
\hline 
0.05 & 0.01 &4 &Unstable \\ 
\hline 
 0.1& 0.001 & 0.1 &Stable \\ 
\hline 
0.1 & 0.005 & 0.5 &Stable \\ 
\hline 
0.1 &0.0051 &0.51 &Unstable\\
\hline
\end{tabular} 
\end{center}

It is possible to show that, in order to have a stable solution, the following condition must be satisfied : $\frac{\Delta t}{\Delta x^2} \leq \frac{1}{2}$.

We present a stable and an unstable solution on the figures~\ref{fig:stable},\ref{fig:unstable}.
They were obtained respectively with the calls \ttt{tempEE(10,0.005,2)} and \ttt{tempEE(10,0.0051,2)}. This corresponds to $\Delta x = 0.1$ and $\Delta t = \{0.005, 0.0051 \}$. This gives $\dfrac{\Delta t}{\Delta x^2}= \{0.5,0.51\}$. The unstable case breaks the condition $\dfrac{\Delta t}{\Delta x^2}\leq \dfrac{1}{2}$.

We can clearly see that the solution presented in figure \ref{fig:unstable} is unstable. Indeed, it shows large oscillations and even negative temperatures (which is not possible since the rod is heated).
