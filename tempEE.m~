%TEMPEE Solve the temperature problem with Euler Explicit 
% This function solve the problem given in LAB4 with the FDM for the
% spatial derivatives and with Euler Explicit method for the time
% derivative
% INPUT : hx is the spatial stepsize

% OUTPUT : u is the numerical solution
%          x is the number of points in the x-axis
%          t is the discretized t-axis (from 0 to tend)
